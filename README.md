### Hello there!

#### I made this github repo to store and display my projects in one place.

I am currently a first year student at the University of British Columbia currently studying engineering. 

ðŸ“± My main interest is exploring the world of machine learning and learning how it can be applied to solve real world problem as well as harnessing the power of data science. Though, the interface between software and harware also interests me as seen through my countless sleepless nights I have dedicated to improving my harware skills through robotics as well as computer hardware. 

â˜• Currently I am learning different Tech Stack combinations to allow me to get a sense of software in the corporate world. 

ðŸ’» I have listed some of the projects that I have done onto this portfolio. I hope you enjoy it and see, some of my skills and talents in programming and software development!

ðŸ“« If there are any questions or concerns, you can reach me on at my email: Tonyjiang5678@gmail.com
